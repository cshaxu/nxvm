# Project Status

## Current Work

M6 T43 and M6 Td S3 remain closed. M7 T44 S1 is accepted after actual-diff
review of Shared P1 ae15f9129 and MyNES P2 b2c973f69. T44 stays open; no S is
active. Next candidate is S2 Mapper address computation, not yet admitted.

Latest governance: owner approved latest-pair-only retention on 2026-09-25.
Shared P1 330c8cd18 updates Execution; NXVM P2 b85f72179 removes sixteen old
0533/0534 EXEs; MyNES P3 removes four old 0041/0042 EXEs and updates its asset
guide. At that cleanup the inventory was ten EXEs (MyNES two 0043, NXVM eight 0535); all ten
SHA-256 values match the pre-cleanup baseline. Both documentation gates and
diff/check pass. Configurations, snapshot, media and executable inputs are
unchanged; no rebuild is needed. Deleted EXEs remain recoverable in Git history.

| Task | Progress |
| --- | --- |
| T43 | Closed on owner instruction: S1-S13 accepted batches reconciled in history; final x64/x86 suites 132/132, six-ROM graphics/text matrix 24/24; remaining deferred contracts have explicit TODO receivers. |
| T44 S1 | S1 closed: fixed-processor before/after baseline, exact palette proof, 24 paired game routes, complete MyNES suites 56/56 per width and optimized stripped 0044 pair accepted. T remains open; S2 not admitted. |

## Current Technical Baseline

- MyNES: optimized stripped 0044 x64/x86 pair in `assets/mynes/`, built from
  S1 implementation b2c973f69 and identified by the hashes in
  [S1 evidence](../etc/evidence/m7-t44-s1-palette-performance.md).
  Full MyNES suites pass 56/56 per width; exact paired game/frame/PCM/state
  proof covers six ROMs and both output modes. Only frame-local palette lookup
  changed production behavior; owner INI and v3 snapshot remain untouched.
  Superseded 0043 binaries remain in Git history, not the deployment directory.
- Shared: 268464d49; executable behavior is 064b9619b (T538 S7 P1), with
  P4's owner-requested key-specific comment clarification and updated manifest.
  Lib source/test roots add that correction; S5's two test roots retain the
  boundary/retirement corrections for SoftPC to import, including removal of
  its cross-owner fixture. No complete SoftPC parity is claimed. Transfer complete
  roots with removals; test/register.cmake remains unchanged.
  Six manifests and Types gates pass. All receiving Apps were rebuilt together.
- Snapshot `MNS1` guest state remains Core-owned; transient driver stop/frame
  publication state is reset only after successful restore. Deferred work remains
  explicitly listed in [TODO](TODO.md), not implicitly claimed complete.
