# Project Status

## Current Work

M6 T43 is closed by owner acceptance. No MyNES task or subtask is active.

| Task | Progress |
| --- | --- |
| T43 | Closed on owner instruction: S1-S13 accepted batches reconciled in history; final x64/x86 suites 132/132, six-ROM graphics/text matrix 24/24; remaining deferred contracts have explicit TODO receivers. |

Archived proposal: [six-component Types boundary audit](../history/M6-T43-six-component-types-boundary-audit-proposal.md).
History: [T43 accepted work](../history/M6-T43-six-component-types-boundary-audit.md).
Evidence: [S9 snapshot resume](../etc/evidence/m6-t43-s9-snapshot-resume.md).
Current audit: [S13 stopped startup](../etc/evidence/m6-t43-s13-stopped-startup.md).
Artifact evidence: [S10 registration and byte boolean](../etc/evidence/m6-t43-s10-registration-byte-bool.md).

## Current Technical Baseline

- MyNES: optimized stripped 0043 x64/x86 artifacts in `assets/mynes/`,
  rebuilt for S13 P1 dd2de1936 and recorded in S13 evidence; accepted by owner.
  Owner-provided v3 snapshot is committed in S13 P3 9b2b10ce2.
- Shared: S10 75099c178; transfer the six roots plus test/register.cmake.
  Six manifests and Types gates pass. All receiving Apps were rebuilt together.
- Snapshot `MNS1` guest state remains Core-owned; transient driver stop/frame
  publication state is reset only after successful restore. Deferred work remains
  explicitly listed in [TODO](TODO.md), not implicitly claimed complete.
