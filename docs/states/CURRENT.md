# Project Status

## Current Work

**Active.** M5 T364 S1 inventories every selected PC/AT device, chip, port,
route, lifecycle and timing owner before any later NMI or bus-time allocation.

## M5 T364 S1 Packet

| Field | Required record |
| --- | --- |
| Identifier Mode | New |
| Admission And Approval | The owner directed implementation of the next Queue task on 2026-08-14 after accepting T363. This is the ordered PC/AT completeness-audit candidate; Git pushes are permitted. |
| Objective | Produce one complete selected-PC/AT hardware completeness ledger covering CPU-visible buses/ports, PIC/PIT/RTC, DMA, KBC/AUX/PPI/NMI, VADP, FDC/ATA, memory/ROM, IRQ/DRQ/reset routes and selected optional-interface dispositions. |
| Non-goals | No device implementation, no NMI source selection, no bus waits/service duration, no firmware/media import, no host backend, no Windows claim, and no physical/cycle-exact claim. |
| Reference Baseline | `838080b1` / `vm-0-5-0362`; T346--T354 component evidence, T353 PC/AT topology closure, T363 timing closure, and the Queue proposal. |
| Candidate Proposal | [PC/AT device, chip, port, and bus completeness audit](../proposals/m5-pcat-device-completeness-audit.md). |
| Files And ABI Surface | Indexed T364 evidence, task history and status only unless a verified inventory defect requires later admission. No public ABI. |
| Applicable Rules | Task Reading Set; Execution source/evidence/closure rules; Documentation topology; Architecture ownership and source/research policy. Code rules are not triggered unless later implementation is admitted. |
| Verification | Source/route/lifecycle/consumer/gap sweep across selected core and VM composition, all retained evidence and Queue/TODO receivers; documentation governance and diff check. |
| Expected Markers | T364 S1 selected-PC/AT completeness ledger marker and retained topology/transaction markers. |
| Asset Needs | Existing read-only primary-source provenance only; no retained download, code, firmware or guest media. |
| Reporting Requirements | State each selected/absent/incomplete component, its contract and owner, exact gap and earliest receiver; separately identify the NMI-source prerequisite. |
| Stop Conditions | Stop and transfer any controller lacking a primary contract, selected corpus, or single lifecycle/timing owner; never synthesize a device or source. |
| Exit Criteria | One indexed ledger classifies every selected component and optional-interface absence with no unclassified route, timing owner, lifecycle or gap; all receivers are Queue/TODO linked. |
| Original Owner Request | Begin implementing the next ordered Queue task after the complete instruction-timing corpus. |
| Similar-Issue Sweep | Search core/VM devices, port registration, profile topology, IRQ/DRQ/NMI/reset routes, transaction/timeline owners, tests, prior evidence, Queue and TODO. |

## Current Technical Baseline

- **Current developer artifact:** T362 S2 `vm-0-5-0362` /
  `build/output/nxvm_0_5_0362.exe`; its SHA-256 and source commit are
  recorded in the T362 S2 acceptance evidence.
- **T285 display implementation:** `INT 10h` mode `10h` /
  `EGA-640x350x16-direct` has a VADP-owned planar frame path and copied-frame
  consumer boundary; mode 0Dh remains a separate retained path.
- **Core boundary:** T243--T246 retain checked physical memory, immutable ROM
  mapping, and validated real-mode entry plans. The obsolete post-`#UD`
  transition has no public or runtime path.
- **Product boundary:** `nxvm.exe` is the retained runnable product. `mantle`,
  `dos`, and `nxvdm.exe` remain future architecture commitments; they are not
  current runtime or release products.

## Recent M5 Closures

| Task | Compact result |
| --- | --- |
| T363 | Closed at `312ef2f9`: all 256 primary and 256 secondary dispatch slots have one source-backed successful-retirement owner or an exact explicit receiver; inventory and 246/246 current-gate passed. [Closure audit](../etc/evidence/t363-s7-complete-instruction-timing-closure-audit.md). No physical/cycle-exact L3 claim. |
| T362 | Closed at `316c2334`: S1--S2 normalize every eligible 80186 immediate-IMUL source row in one private direct/constrained model table; S3 resolves stale full-gate verifier assumptions and records 246/246 current-gate tests. [Closure audit](../etc/evidence/t362-s3-legacy-timing-normalization-closure-audit.md). Model-L3 only; no physical/cycle-exact claim. |
| T361 | Closed at `a5442d96`: S1--S3 established the source-labelled 8086/80186 allocation and synchronous-fault publication boundary; S4 retained Intel 210498-005 Appendix-B `90 NOP = 3` after a page/context and consumer audit. Immediate-IMUL normalization transfers to the first Queue candidate. [S4 evidence](../etc/evidence/t361-s4-80286-nop-source-consumer-audit.md). No physical or cycle-exact claim. |
| T360 | Closed four-profile timing source reconciliation: primary-authority inventory, owner-selected 80286 NOP table precedence, exact legacy range transfer, contextual classifier audit, and final source/receiver closure. 245/245 current-gate tests passed; no L3 or cycle-exact claim. [Closure audit](../etc/evidence/t360-s5-four-profile-timing-source-closure-audit.md). |
| T359 | Closed its bounded four-profile instruction-retirement corpus: S1 inventory plus S2--S6 source classifiers use one successful-retirement publisher; S7 verifies all unallocated rows transfer to T360, bus/service, cycle-exact, or x87/VME receivers. 245/245 current-gate tests passed. No L3 or cycle-exact claim is made. [Closure audit](../etc/evidence/t359-s7-complete-instruction-timing-closure-audit.md). |
| T358 | Closed cross-mode mechanism coherence: reconciled I/O permission, exception/IRQ entry, selector/task/return transition, paging/linear access, and prefix/LOCK/width/string classifiers; repaired 80286 delivery, LOCK group legality, and repeated-width preview divergence; passed 240 current-gate tests. [Closure audit](../etc/evidence/t358-cross-mode-mechanism-closure-audit.md). |
| T357 | Closed finite source-backed 8086/80186/80286/80386 instruction timing at one successful-retirement publisher: selected form ledgers, 80386 protected/VM86 ordinary I/O, Appendix-B `NOP = 3` consumer reconciliation, 240 current-gate tests, and artifact SHA-256 `83A249015C03CF875896A440D5B43A430C2D875A63F0BE4B9709014A753CAD95`. Unselected forms, waits, physical bus/prefetch, device latency and cycle-exact work remain explicit transfers. [Closure audit](../etc/evidence/t357-s8-cross-profile-closure-audit.md). |
| T356 | Closed the M5 closure audit with an explicit M5-open decision: all selected device owners are evidenced, but instruction timing, bus availability/wait states and selected-profile cycle exactness remain ordered implementation prerequisites; corpus-gated peripheral, storage and product boundaries remain explicit transfers. [History](../history/M5-T356-m5-closure-audit.md). |

## Recent Governance

- **M5 Td S89 P1:** made the queued complete instruction-timing proposal the
  sole current explanation of the shared four-profile audit method and the
  distinct 8086/80186/80286/80386 accounting boundaries. It changes neither
  rules, README, Queue ordering, TODO, runtime, nor the documentation
  topology. Documentation governance and diff check passed.

- **M5 Td S90:** made completed PC/AT device-service timing an explicit
  prerequisite of selected-profile model-L3 phase refinement; retained the
  established Queue order and withdrew the unstarted T362 preparation.
  Documentation governance and diff check passed; Td work has no runtime,
  artifact, or task-activation change.

- **M5 Td S89:** converted the remaining primary-source and PC/AT NMI debt
  into three bounded proposals; ordered authority review before the complete
  timing corpus, and device audit before NMI ownership and physical timing.
  Documentation governance and diff check passed; Td work has no runtime,
  artifact, or task-activation change.

- **M5 Td S88:** reconciled the active T359 mechanism plan after S3 acceptance:
  S4 owns the stateful string/repeat/ordinary-I/O timing mechanism, and the
  secondary, privileged, and closure units follow as S5--S7. Documentation
  governance, the T359 inventory verifier, and diff check passed; Td work has
  no runtime or artifact change.

- **M5 Td S87:** reconciled the T358 continuation handoff: removed the
  duplicate empty history heading, retained the approved Queue order, and
  restored compact open-T358 status. Documentation governance and diff check
  passed; Td work has no runtime or artifact change.

- **M5 Td S87:** reordered M5 around four-profile timing authority,
  device/chip/port/bus completeness, bus availability, service timing,
  cycle-exact selected-profile work, and L3 closure before final BYOB Windows
  3.1 Standard/386 Enhanced lifecycle proof. M6 now follows the M5 closure
  decision. T358 S1 was isolated during this Td delivery and is now restored
  as the sole active packet. Documentation governance and diff check passed;
  Td work has no runtime change.

- **M5 Td S86:** replaced the completed instruction-timing TODO with ordered
  candidates for the remaining full instruction corpus and the independent
  80286 Appendix-B source reconciliation; retained bus-timed and cycle-exact
  work in their dependency order. Documentation governance and diff check
  passed; Td work has no runtime change.

- **M5 Td S85:** corrected the Windows readiness candidate so FDC/ATA
  pending/readiness service is an accepted regression baseline, rather than a
  stale missing-feature blocker. Physical device timing and Windows
  compatibility remain unclaimed. Documentation governance and diff check
  passed; Td work has no runtime change.
