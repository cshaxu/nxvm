# Project Status

## Current Work

**Idle.** Td S75 is closed; the first M5 Queue candidate is now the uncompleted
80386DX architecture-coverage closure audit.

## Current Technical Baseline

- **Current developer artifact:** T331 selects `vm-0-5-0331` /
  `build/output/nxvm_0_5_0331.exe`; commit `0b3ca98d` SHA-256 is
  `DEC95998E27E5F4FAF05D5C7EAFCE62DB0C507D3E9E0EE27A4D46FD513BE18D3`.
- **T285 display implementation:** `INT 10h` mode `10h` /
  `EGA-640x350x16-direct` has a VADP-owned planar frame path and copied-frame
  consumer boundary; mode 0Dh remains a separate retained path.
- **Core boundary:** T243--T246 retain checked physical memory, immutable ROM
  mapping, and validated real-mode entry plans. The obsolete post-`#UD`
  transition has no public or runtime path.
- **Product boundary:** `nxvm.exe` is the retained runnable product. `mantle`,
  `dos`, and `nxvdm.exe` remain future architecture commitments; they are not
  current runtime or release products.

## Recent M5 Closures

| Task | Compact result |
| T331 | Closed the bounded real-mode `ExecFinal` final-delivery construction: `#DE/#MF/#BR/#NM/#GP` share one rollback/diagnostic plan, and `#GP` IVT success no longer records a terminal fault before transfer. Real-mode `#PF` is architecturally outside paging's protected-mode state. The new `#GP` frame/failed-IVT regression, mechanical construction verifier, artifact, and 212/212 current-gate result are retained in [history](../history/M5-T331-exception-final-delivery.md). |
| T330 | Closed the whole-codebase construction-drift package: one task-transition constructor, FDD/HDD backing/create atomicity, CALL-gate dual-fault preflight convergence, and mandatory CPU state-machine mechanism matrices before P1. Intel-required layouts remain explicit; T330 artifact, focused regressions, 211/211 current-gate, and governance evidence are in [history](../history/M5-T330-width-path-convergence.md). |
| T329 | Closed the bounded Intel 80286/80386 protected task-transition state machine: 16/32-bit direct and task-gate entry, nested CALL/IRET state, incoming LDT images, source-CR3 preflight/incoming-CR3 commit, and TSS post-switch `#DB`. S7 proves target-page fetch, target-TSS `#PF` atomicity, and a target-state restart frame; the 0329 artifact and 211/211 gate result are in [history](../history/M5-T329-task-transition-state-machine.md). |
| T328 | Closed the historical LOCK-prefix legality matrix: 8086/80186 retain transparent valid-next-instruction semantics; 80286 adds protected `CPL <= IOPL`; retained 80386 memory-whitelist behavior stays intact. S2 reconciled the current closure map and ordinary matrix, removing the stale Deferred/TODO transfer without changing the user-owned Queue edit. Register, memory, REP, I/O, #GP frame, strict compile, artifact, and 211/211 gate evidence are in [history](../history/M5-T328-legacy-lock-legality.md). |
| T327 | Closed the current/specialized-gate reconciliation: fast smoke no longer builds classified media targets, and generated CTest/Ninja evidence now proves the full 210 = 15 media + 195 non-media partition, both developer roots, all specialized verifiers, and the aggregate's two roots. [History](../history/M5-T327-current-gate-reconciliation.md). |
| T326 | Closed ordinary protected-mode invalid-opcode delivery: `#UD` now reaches IDT vector 6 with a restartable three-dword no-error-code frame, while the explicit error-code classifier retains vectors 8/10--14/17. Four producer classes, invalid-gate containment, retained VM86 and 210/210 current-gate pass. Real-mode IVT migration transfers. [History](../history/M5-T326-protected-invalid-opcode-delivery.md). |
| T325 | Closed the CPU-native Intel 80386DX paging/translation package: CR0, CR2/CR3, 4-KiB PDE/PTE, U/S/R/W, A/D, cross-page atomicity, delivered `#PF`, no-persistent-cache behavior, and pre-486 `INVLPG #UD` are reconciled. Protected `#UD` delivery, task/VM86 paging, and persistent TLB/TR6/TR7 state transfer explicitly. [History](../history/M5-T325-80386dx-paging-translation.md). |
| T324 | Closed current-test/specialized-gate separation: `run-current-smokes` now runs only the full 209-test CTest smoke selection, `run-current-fast-smokes` retains the 194-test non-media selection, and `verify-current-specialized-gates` owns 46 named verifiers plus a mechanical target-graph check. `current-gates-gcc` composes exactly both roots; all layer baselines and evidence are retained in [T324 history](../history/M5-T324-current-gate-separation.md). |

## Recent Governance

- **M5 Td S75:** reconciled Queue state with recorded closures: removed only
  the T323 protection/privilege, T325 paging, T328 legacy LOCK, and T330
  transition-unification candidates; retained the remaining candidate order.
  Documentation governance and diff check passed. Td work has no runtime or
  artifact change.

- **M5 Td S74:** clarified that an executor reports a discovered issue while
  the coordinator alone revises the active packet/brief or admits later S
  work, and renamed the architecture status reference to `CURRENT.md`.
  Documentation self-test, combined governance check, and diff check passed.
  Td work has no runtime or artifact change.

- **M5 Td S73:** replaced ordinary/dual-session branches with one
  coordinator/executor role cycle. One session switches roles and cannot claim
  independent review; two sessions obtain independent coordinator review. P,
  Td/T closure, packet, stop, handoff, and role-authority constraints remain
  explicit. Documentation self-test, combined governance check, and diff check
  passed. Td work has no runtime or artifact change.

- **M5 Td S72:** aligned executor-facing governance: the coordinator creates
  active packets; executor findings are reported for coordinator triage; every
  numbered T packet must link its candidate proposal; and Td P1 is complete
  without a later governance P. Positive and missing-proposal negative
  self-tests, the combined governance check, and diff check passed. Td work
  has no runtime or artifact change.

- **M5 Td S71:** adopted the shared `states/` and `proposals/` topology:
  migrated Current, Queue, and TODO; extracted every Queue candidate detail to
  a linked proposal; updated current links and the topology/self-test verifier;
  and made execution the single authority for proposal admission, task
  numbering, history naming, retention, and withdrawal. Only standalone Td
  work may modify `docs/rules/`. Documentation self-test, combined governance
  check, and diff check passed. Td work has no runtime or artifact change.

- **M5 Td S70:** restored concise purpose-specific reporting and the
  active-contract/compact-Status boundary after later commits had superseded
  them; removed the Queue candidate already closed as T324; recorded bounded
  holistic-execution and task-transition debt candidates with evidence; and
  refreshed the retained governance summary. Documentation default/self-test
  and diff check passed. Td work has no runtime or artifact change.

- **M5 Td S68:** reconciled open numeric-task progress with identifier
  allocation: commit history proves used S/P records, Status structural rows
  determine task closure, and the verifier permits only the exact next S of the
  latest retained-open task under `Continuation`. Added positive and
  skipped/foreign/missing-progress/new-task negative self-tests. Documentation
  self-test, default check, and diff check passed. Td work has no runtime or
  artifact change.

- **M5 Td S67:** defined the two complementary 80386DX completion views in
  goal, roadmap, Queue, and an indexed supporting closure map; retained the
  T316 form matrix as horizontal evidence, and recorded VME/PVI, x87, and
  legacy LOCK boundaries without adding project-specific content to global
  rules. Documentation and state checks plus diff check passed. Td work has no
  runtime or artifact change.
