# Project Status

## Current Work

**No active implementation packet.** T378 is closed. The next and only
5170-scoped Queue candidate is the independent Model-339 L3 re-audit.

| Task | Compact progress |
| --- | --- |
| T377 | Closed at `1cdd5110`: Model-339 is not L3-ready until the native input/global-gate repair and independent re-audit complete. [Audit](../etc/evidence/t377-s1-model339-final-l3-audit.md). |
| T378 | Closed after accepted P2 `c8298c21`: native input proof follows the production transport, virtual-time no longer depends on composition, and its gates pass. [Evidence](../etc/evidence/t378-s1-native-ingress-boundary-repair.md). |

## Current Technical Baseline

- **Current developer artifact:** T376 S4 `vm-0-5-0376` /
  `build/output/nxvm_0_5_0376.exe`; its SHA-256 and source commit are
  recorded by this S4's acceptance record.
- **T285 display implementation:** `INT 10h` mode `10h` /
  `EGA-640x350x16-direct` has a VADP-owned planar frame path and copied-frame
  consumer boundary; mode 0Dh remains a separate retained path.
- **Core boundary:** T243--T246 retain checked physical memory, immutable ROM
  mapping, and validated real-mode entry plans. The obsolete post-`#UD`
  transition has no public or runtime path.
- **Product boundary:** `nxvm.exe` is the retained runnable product. `mantle`,
  `dos`, and `nxvdm.exe` remain future architecture commitments; they are not
  current runtime or release products.

## Recent M5 Closures

| Task | Compact result |
| --- | --- |
| T378 S1 | Accepted P2 `c8298c21`: production ingress proof and virtual-time ownership are corrected without a test-only API; Model-339 re-audit remains the sole L3 decision receiver. [Evidence](../etc/evidence/t378-s1-native-ingress-boundary-repair.md). |
| T377 | Closed at `1cdd5110`: final audit rejects premature Model-339 L3 acceptance; its shared input/global-gate repair and independent re-audit successors are queued. [Audit](../etc/evidence/t377-s1-model339-final-l3-audit.md). |
| T376 | Closed at `991060a4`: raw-IMG sidecar persistence, selected 8272A command fidelity and malformed-sidecar rejection are proven; physical duplicate-CHRN representation remains explicitly outside pure raw-IMG support. [Closure audit](../etc/evidence/t376-s6-task-closure-audit.md). |
| T375 | Closed at `07484727`: board/device phase work accepts source-backed service and logical-order contracts, transfers raw-IMG fidelity and source-exhausted physical board phases, and **does not accept Model-339 L3**. [Closure audit](../etc/evidence/t375-s26-task-closure-transfer-audit.md). |
| T374 | Closed at `f742433c`: S1--S19 complete the selected Model-339 functional closure and preserve raw-IMG 765 Deleted/Control-Mark/Scan as explicit TODO debt. Board/device timing, final Model-L3, DeskPro 386, PC/XT and Windows 3.1 remain open. [Closure audit](../etc/evidence/t374-s19-task-closure-audit.md). |
| T373 | Closed at `06246a8e`: S1--S4 freeze the three-machine capability ledger and receivers. **5170, DeskPro Model 40 and PC/XT 5160-268 L3 are not ready.** [Closure audit](../etc/evidence/t373-s4-task-closure-audit.md). |
| T372 | Closed at `3f56c72c`: Model 339 has selected logical ownership and deterministic ordering, but lacks selected-device functional closure and source-backed board/phase timing. [Closure audit](../etc/evidence/t372-s8-task-closure-transfer-audit.md). |

## Recent Governance

- **M5 Td S94 P1:** locks the DeskPro 386 Model 40 and PC/XT 5160-268
  baselines, establishes capability-ledger then functional-before-timing
  closure for all three machines, and retains external ROMs outside Git.
