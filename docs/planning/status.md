# Project Status

## Current Work

**M5 idle: T249--T252 are closed; no subtask is active.**

T249--T252 complete the admitted T248 migration queue without changing guest
time, NXVM lifecycle behavior, or product interaction. The next work requires
a newly approved task packet; hardware work remains queued from T253.

| Closure | Evidence |
| --- | --- |
| T249--T251 | Copied input, presentation, and cancellable wait contracts are closed with artifacts `0.5.0248`--`0.5.0250`. |
| T252 | Composition owns the sole run-handle teardown sequence; artifact `0.5.0251` and 86/86 current CTest pass. |

This explicit idle state is permitted only after a completed task closes and
before a new task packet is approved. Existing unstarted hardware work begins
at T253; completed task identities and artifact revisions do not change.

## Current Technical Baseline

- **T252 S3:** `current-gcc` and `verify-current-artifact-target` select
  `vm-0-5-0251`; static/ownership checks and 86/86 CTest cases passed.
  Artifact `nxvm_0_5_0251.exe` SHA-256:
  `5D390E10FFBB229539D3921B22B30085FA482CD88036A1208F76A60443847B49`.
- **T243--T246:** core owns checked physical memory, bounded `#UD`
  transitions, immutable ROM mapping, and atomic real-mode entry plans. T247
  verifies the current artifact target and full gate over that boundary.
- **Product boundary:** `nxvm.exe` is the retained runnable product. `mantle`,
  `dos`, and `nxvdm.exe` remain future architecture commitments; they are not
  current runtime or release products.

Completed implementation detail, artifact history, and rationale are in
[M5 History](../history/m5.md) and Git history. The active task packet above,
the roadmap, and the M5 closure checklist are the only current operational
authorities.

## Recent Governance Updates

- **M5 Td S20:** aligned the five-component architecture.
- **M5 Td S21:** added source-distribution notices and release-record gates.
- **M5 Td S22:** aligned roadmap and trusted external-research boundaries.
- **M5 Td S23:** compacted completed M5 records into history, corrected the
  historical baseline, clarified notice provenance, and removed an untracked
  temporary error file. This documentation task changes no runtime behavior.
- **M5 Td S24:** fixed the time/device ownership vocabulary: core owns guest
  ticks and generic PIT/PIC/DMA mechanics; VM owns PC/AT CMOS/RTC and BIOS time
  semantics; composition owns the bounded product pump and host pacing. This
  documentation task changes no runtime behavior or active-task scope.
- **M5 Td S25:** reconciled completed M5 baseline references to T252 S3 and
  removed stale task scheduling from the completed T248 record. This
  documentation task changes no runtime behavior or active-task scope.
