# Project Status

## Current Work

**M5 T275 S1: FDC Media-Provider Decoupling -- active.**

- **Original request:** decouple the retained FDC state machine from `t_fdd`.
  It must use only the frozen T270 media provider and explicit port/IRQ/DMA
  configuration while remaining in `vm/machine` for this task.
- **S1 deliverable:** inventory every direct `t_fdd` access and freeze the
  provider operations, error mapping, generation/format behavior, probe plan,
  and stop conditions before changing FDC source.
- **Rules:** retain one FDC state machine and the existing DMA2/IRQ6 route; do
  not add a second controller, multi-drive topology, host I/O shortcut, or
  change Console/debugger/boot behavior.
- **Stop:** stop and split if the media contract lacks a required observable
  operation, or the change requires VM-side guest-memory access, a duplicate
  FDD state owner, or undefined guest-visible timing.

## Current Technical Baseline

- **T274 artifact identity:** `current-gcc` and
  `verify-current-artifact-target` select `vm-0-5-0274`; static/ownership
  checks and 107/107 CTest cases passed. Artifact `nxvm_0_5_0274.exe` SHA-256:
  `8E6E3CA707FD9FC9CBA9CE2E1AA1E00436F4BA616583F239FC18C289BFD28D05`.
- **Core boundary:** T243--T246 retain checked physical memory, bounded `#UD`
  transitions, immutable ROM mapping, and atomic real-mode entry plans.
- **Product boundary:** `nxvm.exe` is the retained runnable product. `mantle`,
  `dos`, and `nxvdm.exe` remain future architecture commitments; they are not
  current runtime or release products.

## Recent M5 Closures

| Task | Compact result |
| --- | --- |
| T264 | Closed PC/AT ownership debt without changing retained NXVM behavior. |
| T265 | Added bounded Level 2 instruction-cost attribution with zero default-PC/AT surcharges pending calibration evidence. |
| T266 | Closed bounded VADP CRTC cursor/page/status behavior and copied column/row coordinates. |
| T267 | Added bounded standard PS/2 AUX sample-rate, resolution, and status commands through the core KBC and IRQ12 guest path. |
| T268 | Required DOR.ME0 for FDC drive-0 readiness while retaining FDC/DMA2/IRQ6 ownership and the boot path. |
| T269 | Directly closed block, demand, single, and M2M one-grant semantics; two run quantums replay the same FDC DMA2 DOS result. |
| T270 | Added the frozen multi-device core media contract and fake-provider corpus; retained the old single block slot only as T272's explicitly bounded migration source. |
| T271 | Added a synchronous opaque core/platform backing resource with one close owner; existing copied input and cancellation contracts remain the only such facilities. |
| T272 | Replaced the old single-slot block bridge with frozen FDD/HDD media providers and copied ROM geometry; FDC/HDC direct backing use remains explicitly deferred to T275/T277. |
| T273 | Moved the neutral MC146818 register/calendar/tick/IRQ mechanism into core; VM retains profile NVRAM defaults and the PC/AT 70h bit-7 NMI/71h port adapter. |
| T274 | Added a core-only fixture proving one machine can bind neutral RTC/media/backing providers, freeze, reset, apply an entry plan, and run a bounded slice without VM vocabulary. |

Detailed contracts, commands, artifact provenance, and prior closures are in
[M5 History](../history/m5.md) and Git history. The [M5 convergence queue]
(m5-pcat-hardware-convergence.md), [roadmap](roadmap.md), and
[M5 closure checklist](m5-closure-checklist.md) define current M5 scope; an
active packet becomes an operational authority only after approval.

## Recent Governance

- **M5 Td S30:** compacted completed M5 planning records and formalized the
  then-current T264--T278 forward queue.
- **M5 Td S31:** made `status.md` the sole current-baseline authority, retired
  completed T264--T266 records, and added a documentation-governance gate.
  This task changes no runtime behavior or active-task scope.
- **M5 Td S32:** admitted the original second core/composition migration.
- **M5 Td S33:** corrected it using the external-consumer boundary evidence:
  T271 admits only opaque policy-free host capabilities in `core/platform`,
  extends the migration through T278, and shifts the former forward queue to
  T279--T287. Filesystem, path, mount, and DOS policy remain above core.
