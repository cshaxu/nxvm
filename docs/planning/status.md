# Project Status

## Current Work

**Idle - M5 T297 closed; T298 is the next linear task.**

T297 replaced the default-profile firmware's long-lived raw core binding with
one core-invoked opaque capability. Its runtime whitelist is checked physical
memory and port I/O plus a stop request; no copied CPU-state API was admitted
because no consumer justified it. Configure-time ROM registration is copied
and atomic: a failed callback rolls back only its later ROM routes and owned
copies, retaining earlier mappings and permitting a valid rebind. The callback
borrow ends synchronously; freeze is immutable, reset retains the provider,
and destroy invalidates its context. Default BIOS/QDCGA and boot-failure
handling now use that boundary, with no Console or startup behavior change.

`verify-firmware-capability`, documentation governance, and `git diff --check`
passed; `current-gates-gcc` passed 49 gates and 126/126 CTest cases using an
untracked owner-provided media cache. The artifact is
`build/output/nxvm_0_5_0297.exe`, 2,686,329 bytes, SHA-256
`7ED04D9014F084154C250601C7BFBD186DF2DD4B5652F4D7B4E4CB9CCE327FA5`.

T298 may now be admitted. It must replace debugger raw borrows with copied or
operation-specific core debug capability while preserving the NXVM Console,
debugger commands, prompt, and startup behavior.

## Current Technical Baseline

- **Current artifact identity:** `current-gcc` and
  `verify-current-artifact-target` select `vm-0-5-0297`; its source and
  verification are recorded above. T298 changes the target only when that
  task is formally admitted.
- **T285 display implementation:** `INT 10h` mode `10h` /
  `EGA-640x350x16-direct` has a VADP-owned planar frame path and copied-frame
  consumer boundary; mode 0Dh remains a separate retained path.
- **Core boundary:** T243--T246 retain checked physical memory, immutable ROM
  mapping, and validated real-mode entry plans. The obsolete post-`#UD`
  transition has no public or runtime path.
- **Product boundary:** `nxvm.exe` is the retained runnable product. `mantle`,
  `dos`, and `nxvdm.exe` remain future architecture commitments; they are not
  current runtime or release products.

## Recent M5 Closures

| Task | Compact result |
| --- | --- |
| T290 | Replaced the FDC single-media binding with frozen drive slots and exact DOR/unit selection, proven through core ports, VM composition, and DOS FDD0 regression without broadening FDC behavior. |
| T291 | Made FDC generation, disk-change and motor/DMA cancellation per frozen drive slot, with core port and DOS FDD0 evidence while leaving timing, UI, and commands deferred. |
| T292 | Added prepared-state evidence that selected 67h REP comparison, scan, and segment-override forms already conform; no CPU behavior or artifact changed. |
| T293 | Removed the unused post-`#UD` transition surface, made protected outer `RETF`/`IRET` frame validation non-mutating until commit, and completed its exception/atomicity matrix: non-present returned `CS` is `#NP`, non-present `SS` is the retained terminal `#SS`, and invalid entries are `#GP`; all six `RETF`/outer-`IRET` cases preserve the defined pre-commit boundary. |
| T294 | Completed the codebase-driven public-surface/raw-borrow matrix, fixed T296's three stages and T297's future firmware-capability lifecycle precondition, and left T300/T302 conditional; no runtime behavior, CMake graph, or artifact changed. |
| T295 | Moved CPU execution-to-shared-PIC binding into `core_machine_create`; VM session no longer borrows or binds that path. CPU/PIC lifecycle evidence and all current gates passed; RTC/FDC/HDC/DMA remain T296 and debugger raw borrows remain T298/T299. |
| T296 | Completed A VADP/ports, B DMA/RTC/CMOS/NMI, and C FDC/HDC ownership migration through frozen typed core submissions. S2 `e84199e`, S3 `a02a0f0`, and S4 `fa18847d0aed685554f786c89ba0f5908e539fb7` passed focused owner/lifecycle evidence and the final 49-gate, 125-test verification; T298--T299 remained deferred at this closure. |
| T297 | Replaced default firmware raw profile binding with an opaque core-invoked capability for checked memory/port I/O and stop requests. Configure-time immutable ROM registration now rolls back atomically on callback failure; default BIOS/QDCGA, boot failure, 49 gates, and 126/126 CTests are closed without product UX change. |

Detailed contracts, commands, artifact provenance, and prior closures are in
[M5 History](../history/m5.md) and Git history. The [M5 convergence queue]
(m5-pcat-hardware-convergence.md), [roadmap](roadmap.md), and
[M5 closure checklist](m5-closure-checklist.md) define current M5 scope; an
active packet becomes an operational authority only after approval.

## Recent Governance

- **M5 Td S33:** corrected the external-consumer boundary and shifted the
  former forward queue to T279--T287.
- **M5 Td S34:** repaired queue wording and inserted the approved T279--T283
  reliability/interface package.
- **M5 Td S35:** tightened T279, T280, T282, and T283 task contracts.
- **M5 Td S36:** recorded the WASM media-backing admission boundary.
- **M5 Td S37:** made M5 history static, capped closure summaries, and
  hardened the mojibake governance check.
- **M5 Td S40:** inserted the approved T293--T303 core public-surface closure
  and shifted remaining Windows CPU/FPU/readiness/closure work to T304--T308.
- **M5 Td S41:** retired completed planning detail, made TODO open-only, removed
  tracked local-path samples, and added recurrence gates for those boundaries.
- **M5 Td S43:** superseded the unimplemented T291 S4 admission by merging its
  protected-return fault-atomicity scope into active T293 S1, which retains its
  original post-`#UD` transition-removal scope. T291 remains closed FDC history;
  the unstarted continuation remains T294--T308.
