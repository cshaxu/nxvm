# Project Status

## Current Work

**Idle.**

## Current Technical Baseline

- **T293 artifact identity:** `current-gcc` and
  `verify-current-artifact-target` select `vm-0-5-0293`. Artifact
  `nxvm_0_5_0293.exe` SHA-256:
  `8EA2A81A4EB99F1C541CE9D6CDE3805BBD292A5AFD3A9334A39ED840AE45267E`.
- **T285 display implementation:** `INT 10h` mode `10h` /
  `EGA-640x350x16-direct` has a VADP-owned planar frame path and copied-frame
  consumer boundary; mode 0Dh remains a separate retained path.
- **Core boundary:** T243--T246 retain checked physical memory, immutable ROM
  mapping, and validated real-mode entry plans. The obsolete post-`#UD`
  transition has no public or runtime path.
- **Product boundary:** `nxvm.exe` is the retained runnable product. `mantle`,
  `dos`, and `nxvdm.exe` remain future architecture commitments; they are not
  current runtime or release products.

## Recent M5 Closures

| Task | Compact result |
| --- | --- |
| T286 | Fixed the corpus-proven ATA device-control `nIEN` IRQ14 visibility gap through core-owned controller state, with core, VM-port, and guest fixture success evidence; no DMA, timing, or command expansion. |
| T287 | Fixed bounded ROM CHS device/head, AH=08h caller-pointer, FDISK text-service/window-clear, and HDD-only boot-selection defects; external DOS registers C:, presents stable FDISK copied frames, and hands off from HDD-only ATA boot, while the Standard-mode checkpoint remains a research result, not a Windows support claim. |
| T288 | Resolved the external Setup post-copy `#CE` with the bounded 16-bit protected-mode call-gate and outer-`RETF` path; core and real replay now reach the next `MOV CR0,EAX` `#UD` checkpoint without claiming Windows support. |
| T289 | Materialized the default PC/AT ROM image before provider freeze, including its A20 reset alias, while reset restores only IVT/BDA and mutable device tables; ROM, boot, Console, debugger, and display regressions pass. |
| T290 | Replaced the FDC single-media binding with frozen drive slots and exact DOR/unit selection, proven through core ports, VM composition, and DOS FDD0 regression without broadening FDC behavior. |
| T291 | Made FDC generation, disk-change and motor/DMA cancellation per frozen drive slot, with core port and DOS FDD0 evidence while leaving timing, UI, and commands deferred. |
| T292 | Added prepared-state evidence that selected 67h REP comparison, scan, and segment-override forms already conform; no CPU behavior or artifact changed. |
| T293 | Removed the unused post-`#UD` transition surface, made protected outer `RETF`/`IRET` frame validation non-mutating until commit, and completed its exception/atomicity matrix: non-present returned `CS` is `#NP`, non-present `SS` is the retained terminal `#SS`, and invalid entries are `#GP`; all six `RETF`/outer-`IRET` cases preserve the defined pre-commit boundary. |

Detailed contracts, commands, artifact provenance, and prior closures are in
[M5 History](../history/m5.md) and Git history. The [M5 convergence queue]
(m5-pcat-hardware-convergence.md), [roadmap](roadmap.md), and
[M5 closure checklist](m5-closure-checklist.md) define current M5 scope; an
active packet becomes an operational authority only after approval.

## Recent Governance

- **M5 Td S33:** corrected the external-consumer boundary and shifted the
  former forward queue to T279--T287.
- **M5 Td S34:** repaired queue wording and inserted the approved T279--T283
  reliability/interface package.
- **M5 Td S35:** tightened T279, T280, T282, and T283 task contracts.
- **M5 Td S36:** recorded the WASM media-backing admission boundary.
- **M5 Td S37:** made M5 history static, capped closure summaries, and
  hardened the mojibake governance check.
- **M5 Td S40:** inserted the approved T293--T303 core public-surface closure
  and shifted remaining Windows CPU/FPU/readiness/closure work to T304--T308.
- **M5 Td S41:** retired completed planning detail, made TODO open-only, removed
  tracked local-path samples, and added recurrence gates for those boundaries.
- **M5 Td S43:** superseded the unimplemented T291 S4 admission by merging its
  protected-return fault-atomicity scope into active T293 S1, which retains its
  original post-`#UD` transition-removal scope. T291 remains closed FDC history;
  the unstarted continuation remains T294--T308.
