# Project Status

## Current Work

M5 T542 S1 is accepted and closed. T542 remains open for S2-S8 shared
Machine/helper extraction. No S is active between acceptance and the next
admission. The four-App split remains queued and depends on T542.

| Task | Progress |
| --- | --- |
| T542 S1 | Accepted: complete receiving-owner inventory and construction contracts; no production migration yet. |

## Current Technical Baseline

- `src/x86/chips` owns independent chips; `src/x86/core` owns the sole neutral
  execution/time/memory engine. Flat `x86/ibmpc-common`, `ibmpc-at` and
  `ibmpc-xt` own common/family board mechanisms; genuine D4 remains Model40-owned.
- `x86/product` owns the one PC INI/request/startup, command/hotkey/Debug
  binding, Common composition and process entry/banner. App retains immutable
  identity, fixed config/factory and its real Machine/profile/firmware composition.
- NXVM retains four fixed implemented products under app-nxvm: XT, AT, Model40
  and default. PC110 is not runnable. The independent App split is queued.
- Eight optimized stripped 0541 EXEs reside only in `assets/nxvm/<profile>/`,
  with the runtime debugger and unchanged owner INIs. MyNES retains its unchanged
  0043 pair and does not link Product. Lib/Common and existing x86 implementations
  were not changed by T541.

## Acceptance Evidence

[T541 history](../history/M5-T541-independent-pc-apps.md) maps the complete
Product inventory to its sole receiver, original regressions, all 58 once-only
integration contexts, final 495/495 units per width, standalone and specialized
gates, six manifests, actual-diff review and code counts. S4 records the eight
current artifact SHA-256 identities; S5 confirms they are unchanged.
The [historical design](../history/m5-shared-pc-product.md) preserves the approved
boundary. No hardware timing or new guest-software qualification is claimed.

## Historical Context

[T539](../history/M5-T539-independent-shared-chips.md) closed independent chips;
[T540](../history/M5-T540-shared-ibmpc-integration.md) closed neutral Core/board
extraction. [Queue](QUEUE.md) owns remaining candidates.
