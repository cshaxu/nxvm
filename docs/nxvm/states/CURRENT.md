# Project Status

## Current Work

M5 T556 S8 is complete after coordinator review of `a28cac691`.
S9 is admitted under the owner's request to repair confirmed audit findings.
The owner additionally requires DeskPro source and matching unit tests to be
flat; this supersedes S6's three-subdirectory target without reopening S6.
S9 implementation and final qualification are complete and delivered for owner
review. T556 stays open pending that acceptance.

## Current Task — M5 T556 S9 Audit Repairs And Qualification

| Field | Required record |
| --- | --- |
| Identifier Mode | Continuation: S9 follows completed S8 audit and accepted S1--S7. |
| Admission And Approval | Owner's 2026-10-13 request assigns necessary audit repairs to S9. Targets are NXVM and MyNES, with separate commits. The proposal's existing Shared root-build receiver covers only three PC preset target names changing from 0555 to 0556; public six and shared rules remain excluded. |
| Objective | Flatten DeskPro source and matching unit tests under the owner's S9 amendment; repair A1--A5 under that revised ownership, retain A6's separate Td receiver and complete five-App qualification. |
| Non-goals | No Shared-six or shared-rule edit, unrelated hardware rewrite, new runtime manager, persisted-format change or owner-input mutation. |
| Reference Baseline | S8 audit `a28cac691`; accepted S7 implementation `307cf1bd6`. |
| Candidate Proposal | [Five-App component layout](../proposals/m5-app-component-layout.md). |
| Files And ABI Surface | Core test registration/owner gates; all DeskPro source moved to its App root and units to its unit root, with includes/guards/symbols/build/gates/docs repaired; moved MyNES Machine symbols/callers; corresponding product version/artifact receivers. No Shared API change. S9 actual diff is recorded against the amended flat file map. |
| Applicable Rules | Product guides; shared Execution, Architecture, Coding and Document rules; both product architecture/layout authorities; source policy; architecture-governance and coding-governance skills. |
| Verification | Correct labels/names without reducing cases; reject incomplete D4 attachment with rollback proof; run dual-width full units and every admitted profile/MyNES integration in original Ninja/ccache trees; verify manifests, dependency/doc gates and affected release pairs. |
| Expected Markers | No absolute-path or mislabeled Core tests; no DeskPro chips/machine/product source directories or matching unit nesting; one D4 state owner and one Core attachment owner; missing alias rejects atomically; documents match current source; complete per-route results and ten qualified artifacts. |
| Asset Needs | Existing BYOB inputs read-only; update affected executable pairs only, preserving INIs, media, ROM originals and snapshots. |
| Reporting Requirements | Report per-target actual added/deleted/net lines, retained owners, exact test coverage, artifact identities/hashes, failures and unexecuted desktop checks. |
| Stop Conditions | Required Shared-six/rule change, incompatible saved data, unexplained behavior change or newly expanded hardware scope. Report rather than patch outside this packet. |
| Exit Criteria | A1--A5 repaired with evidence; A6 explicitly transferred; required dual-width builds/tests and artifact checks complete; actual changes reviewed, per-target P commits pushed, clean worktree; T closure still requires final acceptance. |
| Original Owner Request | Admit S8 for comprehensive governance, documentation and code-quality audit; admit S9 for necessary repairs. |
| Similar-Issue Sweep | Search all five App owners and Core plus current authorities for the same stale ownership, registration, vocabulary and contract defects; retain historical terminology as history. |

### S8 Audit Delivery

The [audit ledger](../etc/evidence/t556-s8-quality-audit.md) records six
confirmed classes and their S9 disposition. Both widths pass the 18 selected
static gates; both documentation checks and the production dependency DAG pass.
No new full dynamic qualification is claimed. Production, tests and assets
remain unchanged. Shared-rule vocabulary retains a separate Td receiver.

| Task | Progress |
| --- | --- |
| T556 S9 | Delivered for owner review: 592/592 units and 44 profile/MyNES integration executions per width, both specialized gate targets, documentation/dependency/manifest checks and ten release artifacts. T556 remains open. |

## Current Delivery

The [S9 delivery report](../etc/evidence/t556-s9-quality-repair-delivery.md)
records exact scope, actual diff, logs, artifact hashes and unperformed manual
acceptance. Four PC Apps retain 0.5.0556 under their flat asset roots; MyNES
retains its independent 0.0.0044 pair. The PC target is `vm-0-5-0556`.
MyNES receiving commits are `7fcd7b1d9` and `c5ca06e85`; the NXVM commit
containing this packet/report identifies its delivered source and eight EXEs.
Root preset names use a separate Shared-target commit; the public six are unchanged.

## Historical Evidence

Prior packets remain in the [retained status archive](../history/M5-T556-retained-status.md).
They are not concurrent active tasks. The [T556 history](../history/M5-T556-app-component-layout.md)
records accepted S1--S8 and S9 delivery awaiting owner review.
