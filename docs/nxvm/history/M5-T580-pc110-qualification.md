# M5 T580 — MyPC110 product and guest qualification

## Admission

T580 consumes the existing [MyPC110 qualification proposal](../proposals/m5-pc110-qualification.md)
after T579's bounded real-firmware source gate.  Its end state is four
build-fixed artifacts: original-DSTN x86/x64 and upgraded-TFT x86/x64.  The
task may only claim those artifacts runnable after their specific firmware,
panel, machine, lifecycle, configuration and guest proof gates have passed.

S1 is an evidence-led convergence audit.  It must enumerate every qualification
member and place each in a bounded successor, a source/asset-gated transfer or
an evidenced rejection.  It cannot turn the existing partial firmware trace
into a product acceptance or add a guessed fallback.

## S43--S44: actual timer calibration receiver

S43's sampled execution identifies a deliberate BIOS error halt and a rejected
PIT/refresh delta, superseding the unsampled delay-throughput interpretation.
S44 implementation `1f30224c3` corrects only the App's clock configuration and
existing firmware harness. Both widths report timer pass with delta 1668;
current unit coverage is 712 cases per width, with x64 timeout reruns explicitly
recorded. The code/build-registration delta is +100/-119, net -19.

The [S44 evidence](../etc/evidence/t580-s44-pit-refresh-clock.md) and
[original qualification ledger](../etc/evidence/t580-s1-pc110-qualification-ledger.md)
retain source grades, retained manual views and open product requirements.
Preview construction is verified; complete POST, display, guest and release
qualification remain open. No PC110 product is published by this delivery.

## S45: post-timer reset and firmware service wait

The bounded x64 continuation passes three processor-reset boundaries
and reaches the memory-flag wait calling the 15EE/AX=5380/BH=84 service. It does
not reach a boot interrupt within 200M instructions. No production or test
change remains after removing the sampler. [S45 evidence](../etc/evidence/t580-s45-post-timer-reset.md)
records the actual copied observations and the complete next receiver batch.
